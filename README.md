<p>This project contains:</p>

<ol>
    <li>React-JSX</li>
    <li>API</li>
    <li>Fetch-API</li>
</ol>

## 📝Proyect instructions

This exercise is meant to be completed after the <a href="https://github.com/Criis21/To-Do-List.git">TODO list react application</a> because the first part its the perfect boilerplate to start using API's.

For this second part, we will sync our todo list with a real database, using the following <a href="https://content.breatheco.de/lesson/understanding-rest-apis">RESTful</a> and public API made for this exercise.

This whole exercise is about asynchronous programming because the interactions from and to the server need to be done async. That way the user does not have to wait for the information to arrive.

<ol>
    <li>Make your to-do list sync with the backend API every time a task is added or deleted.</li>
    <li>Add a clean all tasks button that will delete the entire list from the server and update the empty list on the front-end.</li>
</ol>
